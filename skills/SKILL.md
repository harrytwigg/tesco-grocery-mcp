# Tesco Grocery Shopping — Optimised Execution Plan

## Execution approach

Tool calls are executed sequentially (one at a time). The goal is to follow
the phase order below efficiently, making smart decisions at each gate to 
minimise total calls. Don't overthink — just move through the phases briskly.

---

## Execution phases

Every grocery shopping task follows this dependency graph. Phases are sequential 
(each depends on the previous).

### Phase 0 — Setup

1. view SKILL.md (this file)
2. `auto_login` — **must be called at the start of every session** to ensure a valid access token before any authenticated tool is used. If the persistent Chrome session is still valid for the correct user it will return instantly; otherwise it will perform a fresh headless login automatically.
3. bash: cat preferred_items.md (check if exists)
4. tool_search("tesco grocery...")

### Phase 1 — Context gathering

Call these in sequence:
1. get_favourites(count=48)
2. get_current_slot
3. get_basket
4. get_offers (if user has Clubcard)

**Why this comes first:** Favourites contain product IDs, preferred brands, and 
availability status. If a staple item is already in favourites and `isForSale: true`, 
you may not need to search for it at all — just use the ID directly. The basket 
check tells you if items are already there (avoid duplicates). The slot confirms 
delivery is booked.

**Decision gate after Phase 1:**
- Build a lookup map: `{item_keyword → favourite_product_id}` for any staples 
  matched in favourites
- Build an alias map from preferred_items.md (e.g. "sourdough" → specific product name)
- Note any favourites that are `isForSale: false` — search for these in Phase 2 
  using `search_products` (not `get_substitutions`; substitutions run in Phase 4)
- Note any items NOT found in favourites — these need product searches
- Check basket for items already present — adjust quantities, don't duplicate
- **Plan Phase 2 searches** — list every search query you need, then 
  work through them

### Phase 2 — Product discovery

For every item on the shopping list that was NOT resolved from favourites,
issue a **single batched `search_products` call** containing all the queries at
once. `search_products` takes a `queries` array (up to 20 entries) and fans
them out in one HTTP request — do NOT call `search_products` once per item.

```
search_products(queries: [
  { query: "Andrex quilted toilet roll 3 ply", count: 10 },
  { query: "lean beef mince 5% 1kg", count: 10 },
  { query: "bananas", count: 6 },
  ...
])
```

Each result in the response echoes the `query` and `index` from the input so
you can map results back to items. Per-query failures come back as
`{ ok: false, error }` entries — the rest still succeed.

**Search query guidelines:**
- Use the product alias from preferred_items.md if one exists
- Keep queries specific: include brand + size + key attribute (e.g. "5% fat")
- For branded items (toilet paper, coffee, cleaning products), ALWAYS lead 
  with the brand name (e.g. "Andrex quilted toilet roll 3 ply") — generic 
  queries like "toilet paper 3 ply" return overpriced marketplace bulk results
- Use `count: 6` for straightforward items (bananas, watermelon, pineapple — 
  usually only 1-2 relevant results)
- Use `count: 10` when comparison shopping is needed (coffee, mince, easy 
  peelers where deals and sizes vary); hard max is 24 per query
- Do NOT fire near-duplicate searches (e.g. "lean beef mince" then 
  "lean beef mince 5% 1kg") — get the query right first time
- For items where you need to compare deals, include enough in the first query
- If the shopping list exceeds 20 items, split into two batched calls

**Decision gate after Phase 2:**
- For each item, select the best product considering:
  1. Favourite status (prefer favourites)
  2. Clubcard deals (user has Clubcard — always factor in discounted price)
  3. Price per unit (compare £/kg, £/litre, £/each)
  4. Ratings and reviews
  5. Brand preference from preferred_items.md
  6. Availability (isForSale must be true)
- Flag quality/price trade-offs for user review (e.g. standard vs Finest)
- If any search returned poor results (e.g. marketplace bulk items), retry 
  with a refined query
- For items where `isForSale: false` in favourites, select the best available 
  match from search results — do NOT call `get_substitutions` yet (that 
  happens in Phase 4 if the item fails basket verification)

### Phase 3 — Add to basket (single call)

One `add_to_basket` call with ALL selected items:

```
add_to_basket(items: [{id, quantity}, {id, quantity}, ...])
```

Include every item in one call. Never add items one at a time.

### Phase 4 — Verification & substitution

Phase 4 is where substitutions happen. Only after adding items to the basket 
and verifying their status can you confirm what is truly unavailable.

**Phase 4a — Verify basket:**

Single call: `get_basket` — verify all items added correctly.

Check every item in the basket response:
- `status: "AvailableForSale"` → good
- `status` is anything else, or item is missing → needs substitution
- Quantity mismatch → correct with add_to_basket (quantity overwrite)

**Phase 4b — Substitution search (only if needed):**

If ANY items failed verification, run `get_substitutions` for each:

```
get_substitutions(query: "<product title>", excludeId: "<id>")
```

One call per unavailable item. If `get_substitutions` returns poor results for 
any item, also run a `search_products` fallback query.

Evaluate each substitution against user preferences (brand, size, price).

**Phase 4c — Add replacements & re-verify (only if needed):**

1. Single `add_to_basket` call with all replacements + `quantity: 0` for items 
   being replaced
2. `get_basket` to re-verify everything

Always note substitutions in the Phase 5 summary so the user can review.

### Phase 5 — Summary (ALWAYS use show_widget)

**Never present the summary as plain text.** Always use `visualize:show_widget` 
to render an interactive HTML summary. The widget has four mandatory sections, 
described below. Call `visualize:read_me(modules: ["chart"])` before your first 
widget call if you haven't already in this conversation.

The summary widget is the final deliverable — it's what the user sees and 
interacts with. It must be comprehensive, scannable, and actionable.

---

## Summary widget template

The Phase 5 summary MUST be rendered as a `visualize:show_widget` call with 
`title: "tesco_basket_summary"`. The widget contains four sections in order:

### Section 1 — Metric cards (top row)

A responsive grid of 4 summary cards using `var(--color-background-secondary)`:

```
┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
│ Basket total │ │ Items        │ │ Delivery     │ │ Clubcard     │
│ £57.93       │ │ 19           │ │ £4.50        │ │ savings      │
│              │ │              │ │              │ │ ~£4.65       │
└──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
```

HTML pattern:
```html
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(140px, 1fr)); gap: 12px; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  <div style="background: var(--color-background-secondary); border-radius: var(--border-radius-md); padding: 1rem;">
    <p style="font-size: 13px; color: var(--color-text-secondary); margin: 0;">Basket total</p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 500; margin: 4px 0 0;">£XX.XX</p>
  </div>
  <!-- repeat for Items, Delivery, Clubcard savings -->
  <!-- Clubcard savings value uses color: #0F6E56 (teal-600) -->
</div>
```

### Section 2 — Item tables (staples + extras)

Two separate tables: "Staple items" and "This week's extras" (only if extras exist).
Each table has 4 columns: Item, Qty, Price, Notes.

Column behaviour:
- **Item**: Product name, shortened to essentials (drop "Tesco" prefix where obvious)
- **Qty**: Centred, just the number
- **Price**: Right-aligned. If Clubcard price, wrap in `<span style="color: #0F6E56">`
- **Notes**: Short annotation — one of:
  - `Favourite` (gray) — item matched from favourites
  - `Clubcard price` (teal #0F6E56) — Clubcard deal applied
  - `Sub for unavailable [X]` (warning color) — substitution made
  - `Per alias` (gray) — resolved from preferred_items alias
  - `[quantity note]` (gray) — e.g. "= 1kg total" for split-pack items
  - Flagged with `⚖️` if there's a quality/price trade-off (see Section 3)

Both tables (staples and extras) MUST use identical `table-layout: fixed` and 
`<colgroup>` so columns align vertically across sections.

HTML pattern per table:
```html
<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500; margin: 0 0 12px;">Staple items</h2>
<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
<table style="width: 100%; font-size: 14px; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed;">
<colgroup>
  <col style="width: 42%;">
  <col style="width: 8%;">
  <col style="width: 12%;">
  <col style="width: 38%;">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary);">
  <th style="text-align: left; padding: 8px 4px; color: var(--color-text-secondary); font-weight: 400;">Item</th>
  <th style="text-align: center; padding: 8px 4px; color: var(--color-text-secondary); font-weight: 400;">Qty</th>
  <th style="text-align: right; padding: 8px 4px; color: var(--color-text-secondary); font-weight: 400;">Price</th>
  <th style="text-align: left; padding: 8px 4px; color: var(--color-text-secondary); font-weight: 400;">Notes</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary);">
    <td style="padding: 8px 4px;">Product name</td>
    <td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
    <td style="text-align: right;">£X.XX</td>
    <td style="padding: 8px 4px; font-size: 12px; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Note</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- more rows -->
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
```

**Notes column guidance:** Keep notes under ~50 characters to avoid heavy 
wrapping in the fixed-width column. Prefer short forms like 
"Clubcard price (was £X)" over verbose explanations.

### Section 3 — Decision cards (trade-offs for user review)

For every item where Claude chose the value option but a quality upgrade exists 
(or vice versa), show a decision card. These MUST use `sendPrompt()` buttons 
so the user can swap with one tap.

When to show a decision card:
- Standard vs Finest variant exists with meaningful quality/price difference
- A Clubcard deal makes an alternative notably cheaper
- Claude chose a substitution the user might want to override
- Multiple coffee/speciality options with different deals

Each card shows:
- What was added and why (bold label + price)
- The alternative and what it costs
- A swap button that calls `sendPrompt('Swap [item] to [alternative]')`

HTML pattern:
```html
<h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500; margin: 1.5rem 0 12px;">Decisions for your review</h2>
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 12px;">

<div style="background: var(--color-background-primary); border-radius: var(--border-radius-lg); border: 0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary); padding: 1rem 1.25rem;">
  <p style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 14px; margin: 0 0 6px;">Item name</p>
  <p style="font-size: 13px; color: var(--color-text-secondary); margin: 0;">
    <b>Added:</b> Product A — £X.XX (reason)<br>
    <b>Alternative:</b> Product B — £Y.YY (reason, rating difference)
  </p>
  <button style="margin-top: 8px; font-size: 13px;" 
    onclick="sendPrompt('Swap [item] to [alternative description]')">
    Swap to [alternative] ↗
  </button>
</div>

<!-- more cards -->
</div>
```

If there are NO trade-offs to flag, omit Section 3 entirely — don't show an 
empty "Decisions" heading.

For information-only notes (e.g. "Caffè Crema not available, Rossa is best deal"), 
use a card WITHOUT a swap button — just the explanation text.

### Section 4 — Delivery footer

A muted bar at the bottom with slot details and estimated total:

```html
<div style="margin-top: 1.5rem; padding: 12px 16px; background: var(--color-background-secondary); border-radius: var(--border-radius-md); font-size: 13px; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
  Delivery: [day] [date], [time] · Delivery charge: £X.XX · Est. total with delivery: £XX.XX
</div>
```

### Widget assembly rules

1. All four sections go in a single `show_widget` call — never split across 
   multiple calls
2. Wrap everything in `<div style="padding: 1rem 0;">` for breathing room
3. Use CSS variables for all colours except the teal Clubcard highlight (#0F6E56) 
   which is hardcoded for emphasis
4. Tables use `overflow-x: auto` wrapper for mobile safety
5. Both tables MUST use identical `table-layout: fixed` and `<colgroup>` with 
   the same column widths (42% / 8% / 12% / 38%) so columns align vertically
6. All borders are `0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary)`
6. The widget title is always `tesco_basket_summary`
7. Loading messages should be grocery-themed and playful, e.g.:
   `["Tallying the trolley totals", "Checking Clubcard savings", "Sorting the shopping"]`

### After the widget

Follow the widget with a SHORT prose summary (3-5 bullet points max) covering:
- Key substitutions made and why
- The best deal/Clubcard insight
- Any items that need user decision
- Offer to save/update preferred_items.md

Do NOT repeat the full item list in prose — the widget already shows everything. 
The prose should add context the widget can't (e.g. "No 1kg lean mince exists, 
so I combined 750g + 250g").

---

## Swaps use a single add_to_basket call

When swapping one product for another, use ONE `add_to_basket` call:
```json
{ "items": [
    { "id": "OLD_PRODUCT_ID", "quantity": 0 },
    { "id": "NEW_PRODUCT_ID", "quantity": 1 }
]}
```
Setting `quantity: 0` removes the old item. Never use `remove_from_basket` 
followed by `add_to_basket` — that's two round-trips for a one-call operation.

---

## Dependency rules

### Phase order (sequential)
```
Phase 0 → Phase 1:   auto_login must succeed before any authenticated tool is called
Phase 1 → Phase 2:   Searches depend on knowing what's in favourites
Phase 2 → Phase 3:   Adding depends on product selection
Phase 3 → Phase 4a:  Verification depends on add completing
Phase 4a → Phase 4b: Substitutions depend on knowing what's unavailable
Phase 4b → Phase 4c: Replacement adds depend on substitution selection
```

### Where get_substitutions belongs
```
❌ Phase 2 — too early, availability not yet confirmed by basket
✅ Phase 4b — after get_basket reveals which items are unavailable
```
`get_substitutions` must ONLY run after `get_basket` (Phase 4a) confirms 
that an item's status is not `AvailableForSale`. Favourites showing 
`isForSale: false` is a hint, but the basket is the source of truth — 
sometimes items show unavailable in favourites but are available when 
added. Always attempt to add first, then substitute based on basket 
verification results.

---

## Preferred items file

Location: `/mnt/user-data/uploads/preferred_items.md` or as specified by user.

### Format
```markdown
# Preferred Items

## Aliases
- alias - product name - product id (if known)

## Brand preferences
 - product name

## Staple items (add weekly unless excluded)
- 1 × Tesco Whole Milk 2L
- 1 × Arla Lactofree Whole Milk 2L
- 2 × Tesco Perfectly Ripe Mango
- 1 × Tesco Pink Lady Apples 5 Pack
- ... etc
```

### Using the file
- Check aliases BEFORE searching — search using the resolved product name
- If a product ID is stored, try adding directly via `add_to_basket` without 
  searching (but verify it's still available in the Phase 4 check)
- After user confirms the basket, offer to create/update this file with the 
  brands and products they chose this session

---

## Clubcard pricing logic

The user has a Tesco Clubcard. When comparing products:

1. Always use the Clubcard price (not shelf price) for comparison
2. The `promotion` field shows Clubcard deals:
   - `clubcardOnly: true` means the deal requires Clubcard
   - `discountedPrice` is the Clubcard price (if present)
   - Some deals are conditional (e.g. "Any 2 for £4") — factor in whether 
     the user is buying the qualifying quantity
3. Highlight savings in the summary: "£X.XX Clubcard price (saves £Y.YY)"
4. When two products are similar quality, prefer the one with the better 
   Clubcard deal

---

## Handling unavailable items

There are two scenarios where items may be unavailable. They are handled 
differently:

### Scenario A — Favourite shows `isForSale: false` (Phase 1)

When `get_favourites` returns a product with `isForSale: false`, this is a 
**hint** but NOT confirmation. The favourite listing can be stale.

**Action:** In Phase 2, search for the item normally using `search_products` 
(not `get_substitutions`). If the search returns the same product as available, 
add it to the basket. The basket verification in Phase 4a will confirm 
whether it's truly available.

### Scenario B — Basket item unavailable (Phase 4a)

After `add_to_basket` in Phase 3, `get_basket` in Phase 4a may reveal items 
with a status other than `AvailableForSale`, or items may be missing entirely. 
This is the source of truth.

**Action:**
1. Collect ALL unavailable item IDs and titles
2. Run `get_substitutions` for each unavailable item (Phase 4b)
3. Evaluate substitutions against user preferences (brand, size, price)
4. If `get_substitutions` returns nothing suitable for any item, run a 
   `search_products` fallback query
5. Add all replacements in a single `add_to_basket` call (use `quantity: 0` 
   for the unavailable items being replaced)
6. Re-verify with `get_basket`
7. Always note substitutions in the Phase 5 summary so the user can review

---

## Token budget awareness

A single batched `search_products` call with 15-20 queries × 10-12 products
× ~15 fields each is a sizeable result set. To stay within context:

- Use `count: 6` for straightforward items (bananas, watermelon, pineapple — 
  usually only 1-2 relevant results)
- Use `count: 10` when comparison shopping is needed (coffee, mince, easy 
  peelers where deals and sizes vary)
- Don't request `get_product_details` unless you specifically need nutritional 
  info or extended description — the search results contain enough for selection

---

## Handling swap requests

When the user taps a swap button (or asks to swap an item):

1. Use a SINGLE `add_to_basket` call with `quantity: 0` for the old item and 
   `quantity: N` for the new item
2. Follow with `get_basket` to verify the swap
3. Respond with a brief confirmation including the new price and any savings 
   difference — no need to re-render the full summary widget for a single swap
